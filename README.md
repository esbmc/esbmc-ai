Automated LLM Integrated Workflow Platform. Primarily oriented around Automated Program Repair (APR) research. There are different commands that can be executed with ESBMC-AI. There are different commands that ESBMC-AI can run, and can also be extended with Addons (see [below](#wiki)).

The basic repair implementation passes the output from ESBMC to an AI model with instructions to repair the code. As the output from ESBMC can be quite technical in nature.
